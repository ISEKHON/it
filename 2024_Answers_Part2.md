**Answer:**

#### Difference between Primary and Secondary Memory (4 marks)

| Aspect | Primary Memory | Secondary Memory |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| **Volatility** | Volatile (RAM) / Non-volatile (ROM) | Non-volatile (permanent) |
| **Speed** | Very fast (nanoseconds) | Slower (milliseconds) |

#### Types of Primary Memory (11 marks)

## 1. RAM (Random Access Memory) - 5 marks

**Definition:**
Volatile memory that temporarily stores data and programs currently being processed.

**Characteristics:**
- **Volatile:** Data lost when power off
- **Read/Write:** Can both read and write
- **Random Access:** Any location accessed directly
- **Fast:** Nanosecond access time
- **Temporary:** Holds only active work

**Types of RAM:**

### a) DRAM (Dynamic RAM) - 2.5 marks
**Technology:** Uses capacitors to store data (needs constant refresh)

**Features:**
- Must be refreshed thousands of times per second
- Cheaper than SRAM
- Slower than SRAM
- Higher density (more storage in same space)
- Used for main system memory

**Generations:**
- **SDRAM:** Synchronous DRAM (synchronized with CPU)
- **DDR:** Double Data Rate (transfers data twice per clock cycle)
- **DDR2, DDR3, DDR4, DDR5:** Progressively faster and efficient

**Capacity:** 4 GB, 8 GB, 16 GB, 32 GB, 64 GB modules

**Usage:** Computer's main RAM (system memory)

- More expensive
- Lower density (less storage per chip)
- Consumes less power
- Used for cache memory

**Types of Cache:**
- **L1 Cache:** 32-128 KB per core (fastest, inside CPU)
- **L2 Cache:** 256 KB - 1 MB per core
- **L3 Cache:** 4-32 MB (shared among cores)

**Usage:** CPU cache, high-speed buffers

**Why More RAM Helps:**
- Run more programs simultaneously
- Faster multitasking
- Better gaming/video editing performance
- Fewer slowdowns and freezing

---

## 2. ROM (Read-Only Memory) - 3 marks

**Characteristics:**
- **Non-volatile:** Retains data without power
- **Read-only:** Generally cannot be modified (or very difficult)
- **Permanent:** Contains permanent instructions
- **Small capacity:** KB to few MB
- **Purpose:** Stores firmware and boot instructions

**Uses:**
- **BIOS/UEFI:** Basic Input/Output System (starts computer)
- **Firmware:** Permanent software in devices
- **Bootstrap loader:** Initial program to load OS
- **Embedded systems:** Calculators, washing machines, microwaves

---

**Types of ROM:**

### a) Mask ROM (MROM)
- **Programmed:** During manufacturing (factory-set)
- **Modification:** Cannot be changed
- **Cost:** Cheap for mass production
- **Use:** Old calculators, game cartridges
- **Status:** Obsolete

### b) PROM (Programmable ROM)
- **Programming:** User can write once using PROM programmer
- **Modification:** Cannot be erased (one-time only)
- **Use:** Custom firmware, product serial numbers
- **Analogy:** Like burning a CD-R (write once)

### c) EPROM (Erasable PROM)
- **Erase method:** UV (ultraviolet) light exposure (20-40 minutes)
- **Erase window:** Quartz window on chip for UV exposure
- **Reprogramming:** Multiple times (after erasing)
- **Drawback:** Must remove from circuit to erase
- **Use:** Development, prototyping
- **Status:** Largely obsolete (replaced by EEPROM)

### d) EEPROM (Electrically Erasable PROM)
- **Erase method:** Electrical signals (no UV light)
- **Convenience:** Can erase without removing from circuit

## 3. Cache Memory - 3 marks

**Definition:**
Very small, ultra-fast memory between CPU and RAM that stores frequently accessed data.

**Purpose:**
- Reduce CPU wait time for data
- Bridge speed gap between fast CPU and slower RAM
- Improve overall system performance

**Hierarchy (Fastest → Slowest):**

**L1 Cache:**
- **Size:** 32-128 KB per core
- **Speed:** 1-2 CPU clock cycles
- **Location:** Inside CPU core
- **Split:** Separate for instructions (I-cache) and data (D-cache)

**L2 Cache:**
- **Size:** 256 KB - 1 MB per core
- **Speed:** 4-12 clock cycles
- **Location:** Inside or very close to CPU

**L3 Cache:**
- **Size:** 4-32 MB
- **Speed:** 20-40 clock cycles
- **Sharing:** Shared among all CPU cores

**How Cache Works:**
1. CPU needs data
2. Checks L1 cache first (fastest)
3. If found (cache hit) → Use data immediately
4. If not found (cache miss) → Check L2 cache
5. If not in L2 → Check L3 cache
6. If not in L3 → Fetch from RAM (slow)
7. Copy data to cache for future use

**Cache Hit vs Miss:**
- **Cache Hit:** Data found in cache (fast, ~1-2 cycles)
- **Cache Miss:** Data not in cache, must fetch from RAM (slow, ~100+ cycles)

**Benefits:**
- Dramatically speeds up repetitive tasks
- Reduces RAM access frequency
- Essential for high-performance computing

**Example:**
If CPU needs data from address 1000:
- Without cache: 100 nanoseconds (fetch from RAM)
- With cache (hit): 1 nanosecond
- **100x faster!**

### 1. SUM Function (1 mark)

**Purpose:** Adds all numbers in a range

**Syntax:** `=SUM(number1, number2, ...)`

**Examples:**
```
=SUM(A1:A10)          → Adds cells A1 to A10
=SUM(B2:B20)          → Total of B2 to B20
=SUM(100,200,300)     → 600
=SUM(A1,C1,E1)        → Sum of three specific cells
=SUM(A1:A5,C1:C5)     → Sum of two ranges
```

**Real-World Use:**
- Calculate total sales: `=SUM(B2:B100)` where B column has daily sales
- Calculate exam total: `=SUM(C2:G2)` for 5 subject marks

**Shortcut:** Alt + = (AutoSum)

=AVERAGE(85,90,78,92) → 86.25 (average of 4 scores)
=AVERAGE(B2:B50)      → Average of 49 values
```

**Real-World Use:**
- Student's average marks: `=AVERAGE(C2:G2)` for 5 subjects

=IF(B1>=18,"Adult","Minor")           → Check age
=IF(C1>0,C1*10%,0)                    → 10% commission if sales > 0
=IF(D1="","Empty","Filled")           → Check if cell empty
=IF(E1>=90,"A",IF(E1>=80,"B","C"))   → Nested IF for grades
```

**Real-World Use:**
```
Grade Calculation:
=IF(A2>=90,"A",IF(A2>=80,"B",IF(A2>=70,"C",IF(A2>=60,"D","F"))))

Sales Bonus:
